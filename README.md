# HaskellEuler
A collection of solutions to ProjectEuler.net problems written in Haskell.

More solutions coming soon. Hopefully all of 'em someday :D

Also included is a script (`A_PrintAnswers.hs`) which compiles and runs all others, printing the answers.
Here's some sample output from it as it runs, with solutions blocked out for some reason:
