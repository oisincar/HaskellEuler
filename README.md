# HaskellEuler
A collection of solutions to ProjectEuler.net problems written in haskell.

More solutions coming soon. Hopefully all of them someday :D

Also included is a script (`A_PrintAnswers.hs`) which runs all the solution files and prints the answers.
Here's some sample output from it, with answers blocked out for some reason:
